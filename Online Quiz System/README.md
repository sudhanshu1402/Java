# Online Quiz System

Online Quiz system aims at providing an online comprehensive platform for management of quiz competitions as well as the individuals participating in quiz as a team. The users of the system include administrators, industrialists, institutions, organizations, academicians, and others.
The project provides accessibility to the admins with valid user id and password. The user id and password are required for the admin to “log in” to the application.
In Online Quiz system project, ‘N’ number of teams can be created and they can participate in a competition. Also, ‘N’ number of rounds can be played to finally declare a team as the winner. The teams with lower average marks are eliminated, and remaining teams compete in the next level. This process continues in the next round until the winner is declared.

Participants are automatically given questions, and this is based on time limit. If the participant is unable to answer the question, negative marking is given. There is also a provision of rapid fire round.
The scores obtained by each team are automatically updated. The task of handling of negative marking is done by the administrator. Furthermore, viewing and deleting the quiz results as well as automatic elimination of teams depending on their performance can be done.
